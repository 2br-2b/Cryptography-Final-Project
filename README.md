# Cryptography Final Project

This is a simple implementation of textbook RSA done for my MTH 330: Cryptography final project.

**This is not meant to be cryptographically secure.**

On Sunday, 12/5/2021, I will be publishing a blog post about how this program works. Check it out [on my blog](https://codegito.xyz/2021/12/05/cryptography-final-project)!

See the source code at [src/main.rs](src/main.rs)
